# Heart Disease Prediction and Monitoring System 

## Overview

The **Heart Disease Prediction and Monitoring System** is a mobile application developed as a final-year project using Python and the Flutter framework. This innovative application aims to detect heart disease in its early stages through machine learning algorithms. It leverages input parameters and data from smart wearables (such as health watches, smartwatches, and fitness trackers) to classify an individual’s heart health status.

## Features

- **Early Detection of Heart Disease**: Utilizes machine learning to analyze user data and predict potential heart disease. 🩺
- **Health Monitoring System**: Automatically collects health data from smart wearables, providing continuous monitoring of the user's health status. 📊
- **Personalized Health Care Services**: Offers tailored health recommendations and precautions based on the user's health data. 🌟
- **Proactive Alerts**: Notifies users to take preventive actions if their health status indicates potential risks. ⚠️
- **User Insights**: Provides users with detailed insights into their health status for better management of their heart health. 📈

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Flutter
- **Backend**: Python
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn , metplotlib , pandas
- **Fitbit API**: For collecting data from wearables
- **AI Model API**: Developed on FastAPI to fetch responses for heart disease predictions
- **Firebase**: To store patient data and daily activities for tracking progress
